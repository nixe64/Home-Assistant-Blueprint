This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but **without any warranty**; without even the implied warranty of
**merchantability** or **fitness for a particular purpose**.  See the GNU

### The most important licensing terms in a nutshell

#### Disclaimer of Warranties

There is no warranty for the template, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the template **"AS IS"** without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantablility and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality an performance of the template is with you. Should the template prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

#### Limitation of Liability

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or conveys to the template as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the template (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the template to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

#### Interpretation

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
