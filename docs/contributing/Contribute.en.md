### Feature suggestions and bug reports

If you want to suggest a new feature for one of my projects or if you've found a bug, please open a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/nixe64).

But, **please verify** that you are the first to suggest this feature or to report the bug. Thank you!

### Contributing to my projects

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to any of my projects. There is a lot to do...<br/>
The process is straightforward.

 - Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#best-practices-for-faster-reviews)
 by Kubernetes.
 - Fork the project of your choice.
 - Check out the **develop** branch before you start your development.
 This way, you have already the latest features that are still under development in your code. But you can also start
 with the source of the latest stable release, which is the default behaviour of git.
 - Create a new branch for your work. Commits to the **master** and **develop** branches are **not permitted**. Personally, i recommend the use of 
 [GitHub Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/), but it is not required.
 - Write the code and, if possible, include new tests for your implementation. Changes to the original tests are **not permitted**, unless the test itself has a bug or is incomplete.
 - Ensure your code is working locally and, if available, the tests work.
 - Create a Pull Request against the **develop** branch of the project you choose.

Still interested? **Great, welcome to the team!**
