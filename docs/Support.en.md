## Support and Servicing

### How to get Help

My projects use GitHub Issues to track bug reports and feature requests. Please **search existing Issues first**,
before making a new request.

If you have any problems or suggestions for improvement that have not yet been described, simply open a new issue.

For help and questions about using my projects, please use the [Stack Overflow Questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/) first.
