### Usage

### Feature Requests / Bug Reports / Service Requests

If you have suggestions for new features, want to report a bug, or get stuck on a problem, please first check [Support and Servicing][support-url]. It explains in detail how and where you can make your case.

### Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such a great place to learn, inspire, and create. I would be happy if you would like to contribute a new feature, bugfix or anything else to this project. Anything that makes this project better is welcome. But please read [Contributions][contribute-url] to this project and the [Code of Conduct][coc-url] for contributors first **before** you start coding.

### Acknowledgements

My thanks go to all those who have supported or will continue to support my project and who are actively involved in its realization or who have contributed or already contributed to the refinement and completion of my initial idea with a new point of view and suggestions for improvements. I would also like to thank everyone whose preparatory work I have been able to use for the realization of this project. 

However, I would like to express my gratitude to my friend for her understanding and support, without which my vision will never become a reality (because it often amounts to me sitting late at night and at weekends on the implementation and refinement of my idea, leaving less time for joint activities than she should have deserved).
