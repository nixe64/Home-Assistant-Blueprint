<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="center">
<a href="https://example.com"><img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="Projekt-Logo" width="348px"></a>
</p>

There are many great README templates available on GitHub. However, I only found [**one**](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template.git) that really suited my needs. So I used it as the basis for my default community files.


To get started, please delete this ReadMe.md (also the English language version) and rename ProjectReadMe.md and ProjectReadMe.en.md to ReadMe.md (and ReadMe.en.md). If you're publishing your project in english, rename ReadMe.md to ReadMe.de.md and vice versa.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries needed to launch your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the Acknowledgments section. Here are a few examples.

* [Best-README-Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To use this template for your own projects, just use the "Use this template" button
on GitHub or fork this repository. If you put it in your .github repo
on GitHub, the files in that repository will be used as default for your projects,
that don't have their own community files yet (at least if you have an Enterprise Account).


### Prerequisites

Before you start editing your community files, you should become familiar with the syntax of the
.md files on GitHub. A possible starting point would be the official documentation in [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting) or the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).

Also, it might help if you look around for a "badge maker" (such as
[Shields.io](https://shields.io)) so you can decorate your files with some badges.

I also recommend a development environment of your choice (e.g. Visual Studio Code) and some programs
for image editing (i usually use GIMP and InkScape).

### Installation

This template does not rely on any external dependencies or services.
